# Splice Takehome

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). and definitely hasn't been ejected! ;)

## TODO / Notes

- Calculator theme toggle removed in favor of one on dashboard header.
- Sidebar buttons implemented to toggle sidebars on smaller breakpoints.

- Estimated about 30m for boilerplate and 'planning'
- Estimated 2h for dashboard, styling, flyouts.
- Estimated 1h for dinner. <3
- Estimated 1h for calculator.
- Further time spent casually on refactoring and clean up (probably up until deadline)

- Over estimated my free time, implementing tailwind probably would have made some styling a lot easier.
- Need to refactor the layout page as it's cluttered with data that likely would have come in via API calls.
